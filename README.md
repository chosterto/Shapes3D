# Shapes3D

Something I made a while back for fun. It uses wingdi to project 3D cubes/rectangles.\
You can create as many objects as you want and move them in any orientation (rotate, translate, zoom in & out, etc.)

Build command: `g++ src/[filename].cpp -lgdi32`\
Deploy the render by running the generated .exe file which should pop up in the folder
